# Abstract

This study presents a detailed construction of a low energy Effective Field Theory (EFT) framework that introduces novel charged bosons potentially deemed to be the SM and Dark sector portals. The newly charged mediators have coupling to photon and generally arbitrary couplings to fermions, both matter and dark matter particles, which therefore significantly contribute to hugely vast experimental processes. That adjusts the theoretical prediction of experimental values, particularly lepton decays within the scope of our study. Preliminary to this theoretical development is the verification of the anapole moment's disappearance at the one-loop order, guaranteeing its gauged invariant Lagrangian. By employing lepton decays, we impose constraints on the newly introduced couplings. A pivotal aspect of our analysis involves the use of Michel parameters derived from polarized muon decay, which plays a key role in assessing the chirality effects predicted by the theory. Our findings indicate that the proposed couplings are too constrained to explain the muon g-2 anomaly if a universal coupling assumption is made. In addition, the given coupling pattern of UV models can also be applied to offer a better lower bound of detecting charged boson mass than collider searches that surpass and/or benchmarks with other current experimental searches. 
Last but most importantly, the work addressed the rigorous constraints arising further from Lepton Flavor Violation decays and Neutrino Oscillation within the Zee Model context. Utilizing Michel parameters showcased an impactful point, which set out the comprehensive analysis of limiting parameter space for the Zee model to survive compared to other previous research works. The findings of this study provide a framework analysis for exploring new physics in the weak sector and offer a significant step forward in resolving longstanding anomalies in particle physics.
